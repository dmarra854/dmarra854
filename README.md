### Hi there, my name is DarÃ­o ðŸ‘‹
> "When we were young and fast and invincible, the Road Runner was our hero. Impervious to danger, the Road Runner ran without tiring, scooted without fear and beep-beeped coolly like a blue James Bond.  
> But as I look down now from this creaking tower of years, I see it was the Coyote who deserved my admiration. That TV show was never about the Road Runner. It was always about the Coyote.  
> The Coyote was determined. Determined is a word much misunderstood. Obstinate people are not determined. They merely suffer from too much pride.  
> Stubborn people are not determined. Stubbornness is willful ignorance. Determination is an unblinking willingness to pay the price as often as it must be paid.  
> Determination is never losing sight of your objective, no matter what comes along to distract you. Determination is endurance.  
> How about you? If Failure appears without warning and throws you onto the rocks below, will you happily crawl out of that smoking crater and go back to work?"  
>
